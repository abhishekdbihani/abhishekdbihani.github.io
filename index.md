## Bio

---

I am currently a graduate researcher at the University of Texas at Austin studying fluid flow in rocks. My PhD research focus is on simulating hydrocarbon/CO2 flow in mudrocks to reduce risk during hydrocarbon exploration or CO2 sequestration. My Master’s research involved investigating gas hydrate deposits in Northern Gulf of Mexico to understand methane migration and accumulation in heterogeneous rocks.

Before graduate school, I worked as a Reservoir Engineer at Oil India Limited where our team improved oil recovery through reservoir and well-level analysis for 500+ wells using analytics and modeling. I completed my Bachelor of Petroleum Engineering from the University of Pune, and I interned at Oil and Natural Gas Corporation of India and Essar Oil Limited in Mumbai during my undergraduate studies.

I am excited about applying data science techniques and building machine learning models to help analyze complex and huge datasets faster, objectively, and more accurately. As a data scientist, I want to extract the maximum possible information from the data available from various sources, so that we can use it to make optimal decisions while guided by expert knowledge. I am interested in creating workflows which are cross-domain and have a high impact on the end consumer.

## Current Research

---

Mudrocks are a type of rock that act as geological seals for CO2 stored underground or for petroleum in subsurface reservoirs. They prevent leakage by stopping the fluids from flowing upwards through them. However, they can fail if the buoyant pressure of the trapped fluid overcomes their breakthrough pressure.
  
Through pore-network modeling, deep-learning aided image analysis, and lattice Boltzmann simulations, I study the structure of the mudrock seals to determine the conditions when the caprock can fail and permit flow of the underlying stored fluid. For this purpose, I have reconstructed the 3D rock structures (and the space between them) from scanning electron microscope images and conducted flow simulations using high-performance computing resources. I found that correlated heterogeneity (connected larger spaces between rock grains) can greatly increase chances of CO2/hydrocarbon leakage through the seal.

[Multiphase LBM for Porous Media using the Palabos library](https://github.com/je-santos/MultiphasePorousMediaPalabos)

This lattice Boltzmann method-based workflow (implemented using PALABOS) can be used for calculation of capillary pressure curves, relative permeability and the percolation pathway of grain packs/image slices.

[Constructing a Synthetic NMR Well-log using Machine Learning](https://github.com/abhishekdbihani/synthetic_well-log_polynomial_regression)

This project attempts to construct a missing well log from other available well logs, more specifically an NMR well log from the measured Gamma Ray (GR), Caliper, Resistivity logs and the interpreted porosity from a well.

[Semantic segmentation of mudrock SEM images](https://github.com/abhishekdbihani/deeplabV3_pores-grains)

This deep-learning based semantic image segmentation workflow (Google’s Deeplab-v3+ model implemented using Tensorflow) can be used to segment pores, silt-sized grains and clay from scanning electron microscope mudrock images.

[Grain Variogram Calculation](https://github.com/abhishekdbihani/Grain-variogram-calculation)

This script attempts to examine if there are spatial correlations between the different spherical grains in a bidisperse (two-sized) grain pack by constructing variograms for measuring the spatial distribution of grain volumes and the inter-granular distances
