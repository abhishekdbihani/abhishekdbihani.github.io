[Multiphase LBM for Porous Media using the Palabos library](https://github.com/je-santos/MultiphasePorousMediaPalabos)

This workflow can be used for calculation of capillary pressure curves, relative permeability and the percolation pathway of grain packs/image slices.

[Semantic segmentation of mudrock SEM images](https://github.com/abhishekdbihani/deeplabV3_pores-grains)

This deep-learning based semantic image segmentation workflow (Googleâ€™s Deeplab-v3+ model implemented using Tensorflow) can be used to segment pores, silt-sized grains and clay from scanning electron microscope mudrock images.

[Grain Variogram Calculation](https://github.com/abhishekdbihani/Grain-variogram-calculation)

This script attempts to examine if there are spatial correlations between the different spherical grains in a bidisperse (two-sized) grain pack by constructing variograms for measuring the spatial distribution of grain volumes and the inter-granular distances
